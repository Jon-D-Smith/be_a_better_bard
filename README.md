## Development and release information

This is a closed project with a designated team. At this time we are not accepting pull requests from the general public. This could change once the project is closer to completion, but we have decided to not open source it at this time.

Be A Better Bard is a passion prject being worked on in our spare time, so we do not have a completed roadmap to release date. As we get closer to a tentative release, I will update accordingly.
